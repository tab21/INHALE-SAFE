    para: "Carbon monoxide poisoning is a life-threatening illness that happens after breathing in fumes that contain carbon monoxide (CO). When high levels of CO enter your body, it can be deadly after only a few minutes. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are a headache and shortness of breath. Contact emergency services immediately if you suspect you have CO exposure.",

    title: "Tips on How to Lower CO2 Levels",
    para: `Spending more time at home these days means we may be noticing things we didn’t see before: a crack in the wall, a slow drain. But one thing you probably won’t notice: rising carbon dioxide levels.

    Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is an odorless, colorless natural gas that is released into the air when we breathe. Although CO2 is harmless in small quantities, the buildup of this natural gas can lead to adverse health effects such as fatigue, headaches, loss of concentration, dizziness, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, and more.`,

    title: "6 Most Common Sources of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning",
    para: `Carbon monoxide is a scary gas that can be found in your home. What’s so frightening about carbon monoxide (CO) is that it doesn’t have an odor, color or taste, and therefore can’t be detected by the human senses.

    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 400 people in the U.S. die from carbon monoxide poisoning annually. This is why it’s so important you have working carbon-monoxide detectors in your home that alert you when levels become too high.
    
    What are the most common sources of carbon monoxide poisoning and how do you protect your home? In this article, you’ll learn about some of the first appliances and concepts to think about when it comes to carbon monoxide leaks and safety. Next, we’ll give some advice on carbon monoxide alarms and how you can monitor levels to avoid an emergency.`,

    title: "Carbon Monoxide Detectors: Why Are They Important?",
    para: `Why Use a Carbon Monoxide Detector?
    A working smoke detector is a must-have to protect your home, but just as important is a working carbon monoxide detector.
    
    Carbon monoxide detectors are essential for at-home safety. According to the CDC, every year over 400 deaths and over 4,000 hospitalizations of Americans result from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide, or CO, has no taste or smell to give any warning. Detecting a carbon monoxide leak relies entirely on a detector.
    
    Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include: headaches, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, and confusion.
    
    How does a carbon monoxide alarm work?
    A carbon monoxide detector includes a sensor on the inside indicating the presence of CO in the air. Once the detector senses the gas, it emits a loud sound to alert you of its detection. The CO alarm will shut off once it no longer detects the gas.`,
