    title: "Indoor air pollution: What causes it and how to tackle it",
    para: `Indoor air pollution is created by the release of harmful pollutants inside. These can include fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and various other toxins.

    Indoor air pollution is a big problem in developing countries, where people often burn fuels indoors for cooking and heating. It is also a concern for people living in energy-efficient homes. These properties tend to be relatively airtight, meaning that the air inside can quickly become stagnant and pollutant levels can rise rapidly.
    
    And while pollution in all forms can be harmful, indoor air pollution is particularly pernicious because people are often steeped in it for long periods of time.`,

    para: `Significant policy changes are needed to rapidly increase the number of people with access to clean fuels and technologies by 2030 to address health inequities, achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and mitigate climate change.

    Women and children disproportionately bear the greatest health burden from polluting fuels and technologies in homes as they typically labour over household chores such as cooking and collecting firewood and spend more time exposed to harmful smoke from polluting stoves and fuels.
    Gathering fuel increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and consumes considerable time for women and children – limiting education and other productive activities. In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence while gathering fuel.`,

    title: "Why indoor air quality matters to your health",
    para: `Indoor air pollutants are harmful to long-term health. Learn more about sources of indoor air pollution and how to improve indoor air quality for better health.

    Considering that we spend more than 90% of our time indoors, it’s essential to know how to get cleaner air in your home. Poor indoor air quality can have negative health effects such as allergies, respiratory illnesses, and skin problems. Hence, making sure that your home indoor air is clean and pollutant-free is integral protect your health and well-being.`,

    title: "Environmental and Health Impacts of Air Pollution",
    para: `One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer,`,
