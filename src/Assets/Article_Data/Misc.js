    title: "Indoor air pollution: What causes it and how to tackle it",
    para: `Indoor air pollution is created by the release of harmful pollutants inside. These can include fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and various other toxins.

    Indoor air pollution is a big problem in developing countries, where people often burn fuels indoors for cooking and heating. It is also a concern for people living in energy-efficient homes. These properties tend to be relatively airtight, meaning that the air inside can quickly become stagnant and pollutant levels can rise rapidly.
    
    And while pollution in all forms can be harmful, indoor air pollution is particularly pernicious because people are often steeped in it for long periods of time.`,

    title: "How does the AQI work?",
    para: `Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

    For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.
    
    The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern. Each category also has a specific color. The color makes it easy for people to quickly determine whether air quality is reaching unhealthy levels in their communities.`,

    title: "Understanding VOC Gas and Its Impact on the Environment",
    para: `Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are a group of organic chemicals that exhibit a high vapor pressure at room temperature, meaning they can quickly evaporate into the surrounding air. They originate from numerous sources, including natural emissions and various human activities – even though there are well-documented health concerns associated with VOC exposure. This article dives into the origins and effects of VOC gas on the environment and on human health.

    Unravelling the Origins of VOC Gas
    VOCs originate from a wide range of sources, both natural and anthropogenic. Some natural sources of VOCs include emissions from plants and trees, while human-made sources encompass a diverse array of products and industries:
    
    Building materials: Many construction materials like paints, adhesives, and varnishes release VOCs into the indoor air.
    Household products: Cleaning agents, air fresheners, and cosmetics are common sources of VOCs in the home.
    Office equipment: Printers, photocopiers, and computers can emit VOCs during operation.
    Industrial processes: The oil and gas sector, dry cleaning industry, and manufacturing plants all contribute to VOC emissions.`,

    para: `Significant policy changes are needed to rapidly increase the number of people with access to clean fuels and technologies by 2030 to address health inequities, achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and mitigate climate change.

    Women and children disproportionately bear the greatest health burden from polluting fuels and technologies in homes as they typically labour over household chores such as cooking and collecting firewood and spend more time exposed to harmful smoke from polluting stoves and fuels.
    Gathering fuel increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and consumes considerable time for women and children – limiting education and other productive activities. In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence while gathering fuel.`,

    Considering that we spend more than 90% of our time indoors, it’s essential to know how to get cleaner air in your home. Poor indoor air quality can have negative health effects such as allergies, respiratory illnesses, and skin problems. Hence, making sure that your home indoor air is clean and pollutant-free is integral protect your health and well-being.`,

    title: "Environmental and Health Impacts of Air Pollution",
    para: `One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer,`,
